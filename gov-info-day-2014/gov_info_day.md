#Government Information Day


##Access to information framework
* Democracy best served through transparency
* Declassification 30 year rule - if reason was not given, doc was declassified. Onus was on the public. Now, with ATI&P the burden is on LAC.
* Civics classes have disappeared; rate of creation of governmental records has exploded; formats; currently 460 km of records @ LAC; 35%-40% of which are still closed; inherent limits to block review exercises; description at the series level; and, of course, that's only if our current IM hypotheses hold true in 5, 10, 20 years.
* legislative and judiciary branches should be 100% open/transparent. In an open government setting, the risk of information leaving

##Digitizing Alberta Gov Docs
* [Usage stats](https://archive.org/search.php?query=%28collection%3Aalbertagovernmentpublications%20OR%20mediatype%3Aalbertagovernmentpublications%29%20AND%20-mediatype%3Acollection&sort=-week) are high! 
* Got an IA scribe.

##Digitization of Statistics Canada publications 
* Scope: Officially published publications from SC and the Dominion Bureau of Statistics that were never published in digital format.
* Yearbooks digitized in previous project.
* Raw TIFFs (high speed scanner) and JPEG files (book scanner) egenrated. QC process built in. Business case approved in fall 2010.
* Did not address dissemination component at that time.
* 2788 publications (402K pages). Available from IA and upon request from Stats Can Library. 
* Not funded continuously
* Between 2011 and present: 90- series working towad 10-series. Digitization of the non-census collection. Cataloguing as "DONE".
* Currently: 10- and 20- series plus missing items. Solutions for digitizing very small number of oversized materials are being considered. 
* Expect digitization to be completed by March 31, 2015.
* Challenges: poor condition and single copy publications; centralizing digitization efforts within the agency; workload from increased donations; incomplete catalogue records for older items; scope: what is an official publication?
* Dissemination: procedures have changed for gov websites. Should happen in 2015-16. In discussions with DLI to see if an interim solution can open up access to DLI members sooner.

##Historical Debates of the Parliament of Canada portal
* Collaboraton with Canadiana and LAC. 
* Debates are some of the most requested items. Senate records began in 1871 in English (FR 1895). HoC in 1875. Early Debates project reconstituted debates for the years without an official record and ranslated debates for the years without French official records. (Unofficial).
* PDF-based delivery on canadiana.org (OCRed).

##Canadiana.org TDR
* Took a couple of years (self-audit, submission evaluation, on-site audit, follow-up and certification). 
* Bagit archives; METS, MARCXML,DC; custom http://canadiana.ca/schema; JPEG, JPEG2000, TIFF, PDF; open-source tools (Linux, Perl, MySQL).
* 5 copies in 3 different geographic locations; database of file checksums, files verified against checksums regularly, automatic alerts for missing/corrupt files, manual intervention to fix errors.
* Failed checksums can be repaired.
* 150,000 packages (35 million pages of digital content). 50TB of data (per copy). 
* Canadiana's capabilities/services: digitization, metadata creation and conservation, TDR ingest and preservation, TDR access API, digital library/portal, metadata enhancement & linked data, local repository copy.
* Crowdsourced linked data and metadata

##Internet Archive/Archive-IT
* 1996 - Wayback Machine is created
* 2004 - Book digitization begins at U of T
* 2006 - Archive-IT for targeted web archiving (not crawling like WM)
* archive-it.org
* Heritrix (web crawler), Umbra (crawler to access website like people do), Wayback Machine (for rendering pages), NutchWAX (searching), Solr (searching)
* Archive-IT runs weekly webinars

##U of T web archiving workflow
* Nicholas Worby
* Selection > Test crawl > crawl > auto QA > Manual QA > Metadata creation
* Metadata creation and manual QA are lengthy, time-consuming parts
* UTL's gov info collection: 600+ sites, 2TB+ of data
* Team: 2 librarians; 4 student assistants
* collaborative approaches to QC/metadata are easier when the info are interesting (NYPL menu project)
* City of Toronto Archives collaboration: Negotiating permission > Delivering responsibilities > training > support
* Toronto Archives: QA work on site captures, metadata creation. U of TL: regularly crawling municipal sites, technical support for QA process, metadata creation

#Fugitive Document Working Group
* Web harvesting excluded agencies, contents in dbs, access to info requests (full-text), print publications only?, other jurisdictions?
