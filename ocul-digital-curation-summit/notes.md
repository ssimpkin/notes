#Introduction
Nick Ruest, York  

What could we preserve? What rights do we have to the data (in the case of GIS data, maybe not). What's within scope?  
What can our infrastructure support? (size, type) -- jpeg derivatives, tiff masters, etc. Need to budget for equipment and storage.  

Once you've IDed which objects to preserve:  

Preservation action plan for different types of objects. These include preferred formats. Policy should be consistent and predictable and based on a plan!  

Planning steps:  
* What is your general approach (preservation strategic plan -- what do we care about? what are our considerations? Includes ways to evaluate fixity.)
* What tools are available (archival formats, format normalization, integrity monitoring)
* How do we apply said tools (use cases, write a spec)  

Other considerations: are there different levels of preservation we can offer? For example, WAV and FLAC can be fully preserved, MP3s preserved at the bit-level.  

Another document is the digital preservation implementation plan. Includes guidelines for naming files, fixity checking schedule and methods, as well as preservation levels (bit-level, full, none, etc.)  

Audience vote: let's look at a preservation action plan for audio content at York. This includes content formats, what a SIP submission includes, how files will be described (MODS), FITS datastream upon ingest. Includes information on what's not included, any normalization or metadata normalization, as well as acceptable formats for full-level preservation.  

Parting thoughts: ethos of open source software -- release early, release often. Preservation documentation is all in github in markdown for editing and to allow contributors to submit pull requests.  

#Project management for digitization programs: implementing sustainable projects
Jess Posgate and Loren Fantin, Our Digital World  

Always keep your objectives and mission in mind. 4 Ws and 1 H. Need to identify the objects but also the priorities. Who's your audience? How are you going to do it?  

Breaking it down: the project plan  

* Putting together the plan or proposal (integration, scale, budget)
* What you need to get the job done (equipment, staff)
* Your digital collection (standards, technology, display)  

Projects should be part of larger program plans.  

Digitization is not just scanning! Must consider all stages in the process, risks, contingencies, etc. Going through this process will also allow you to consider the workflow.   
Typical project expenses:  
* 50% staffing
* 20% outsourcing
* 20% software, hosting, user interface
* 8% equipment
* 2% promotion  

To start budgeting for staffing, consider tasks and time required per task/per item. Total = number of items x hours x salary.  

Digitization equipment  

* Hardware (for 2D or 3D objects, conversion devices for AV materials)
* Software (image editing, OCR, audio editing, video editing)

Digital files - need to make sure you have consistent policies/guidelines on naming conventions and chosen metadata schemas. Good file names are under 32 characters to prevent truncation. Storage (master files, vs. web/derivatives), hosting != storage, storage options (server, hard drives, DVD -- consider lifecycles), LOCKSS.  

Evaluation and assessment - regular internal reports and tracking documents. Documentation!  

Metadata application profiles are very important. Let your staff know which metadata elements have to be used, how fields should be completed, which ones can be repeated, etc. Better & smarter metadata will be able to do more later on. Example of KML "smart data" that might allow mapping applications later on.  

Rights and copyright - determine copyright status of EVERY object (ownership versus copyright). In-house tracking (copyright status, copyright owner, donor, permissions, etc. Include as part of the metadata record.) _Copyright status should be displayed as part of the record, as well as attribution information_ Have policies in place - be proactive, not reactive. Think about how you can use existing creative commons licenses for filtering/faceting and clarity for end-users.  

The user community experience - online communities can be defined many different ways and discovery happens in many different spaces. Who are you trying to reach? Consider capturing and indexing comments that people leave in digital spaces - people may tell their stories or provide background information about the content.  

Cultural heritage projects can also be crowdsourced. Want to keep "smart data" in mind (creative commons licenses, geodata). Our Digital World has a copyright FAQ and project management resources on their site.
