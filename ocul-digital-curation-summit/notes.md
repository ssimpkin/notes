#Introduction
Nick Ruest, York

What could we preserve? What rights do we have to the data (in the case of GIS data, maybe not). What's within scope? 
What can our infrastructure support? (size, type) -- jpeg derivatives, tiff masters, etc. Need to budget for equipment and storage.  

Once you've IDed which objects to preserve:  

Preservation action plan for different types of objects. These include preferred formats. Policy should be consistent and predictable and based on a plan!  

Planning steps:  
* What is your general approach (preservation strategic plan -- what do we care about? what are our considerations? Includes ways to evaluate fixity.)
* What tools are available (archival formats, format normalization, integrity monitoring)
* How do we apply said tools (use cases, write a spec)  

Other considerations: are there different levels of preservation we can offer? For example, WAV and FLAC can be fully preserved, MP3s preserved at the bit-level.  

Another document is the digital preservation implementation plan. Includes guidelines for naming files, fixity checking schedule and methods, as well as preservation levels (bit-level, full, none, etc.)  

Audience vote: let's look at a preservation action plan for audio content at York. This includes content formats, what a SIP submission includes, how files will be described (MODS), FITS datastream upon ingest. Includes information on what's not included, any normalization or metadata normalization, as well as acceptable formats for full-level preservation.  

Parting thoughts: ethos of open source software -- release early, release often. Preservation documentation is all in github in markdown for editing and to allow contributors to submit pull requests.
